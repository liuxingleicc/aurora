The surge in location-based services has driven the demand for accurate indoor localization techniques, with WiFi-based localization emerging as a promising solution due to its extensive coverage in indoor environments. This paper presents BFI-L10N, an indoor localization method that leverages beamforming feedback information (BFI) obtained from standard multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) WiFi operations. Unlike traditional channel state information (CSI)-based methods that require vendor-specific firmware patches or restricted device support, BFI leverages standardized MU-MIMO operations, enabling compatibility with off-the-shelf WiFi devices. BFI-L10N processes the BFI data collected during the beamforming process through a deep learning framework and uses a BERT model for localization. In comparison to CSI-based systems, BFI-L10N offers advantages such as reduced overhead, enhanced sensitivity, compatibility with off-the-shelf devices, and real-time predictions. Our experimental results in two distinct indoor environments demonstrate that BFI-L10N achieves average localization accuracies of 10.7 cm and 15.5 cm in a research laboratory and a conference room, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art CSI techniques by 28\%. Moreover, the BERT model can be fine-tuned after pre-training across multiple locations, which enhances the versatility of BFI-L10N. This paper presents a novel perspective on WiFi sensing and lays the foundation for practical indoor localization using standard WiFi infrastructure.
